>From this public table `data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`. Create an efficient query which
derives the total transactions per date and country based on the channel grouping! (Donâ€™t forget to
clean the data and bonus point if using repeated columns)

## Query
```sql
WITH
  cte AS (
  SELECT
    channelGrouping,
    date,
    geoNetwork_country AS country,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitId AS STRING))) AS transactions,
    SUM(totals_totalTransactionRevenue) AS total_revenue
  FROM
    `data-to-insights.ecommerce.rev_transactions`
  WHERE
    NOT geoNetwork_country = "(not set)"
  GROUP BY
    1,
    2,
    3
  ORDER BY
    date,
    geoNetwork_country ASC )
SELECT
  channelGrouping AS channel,
  ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(date,
      country,
      transactions,
      total_revenue)) AS trx
FROM
  cte
GROUP BY
  1
```
